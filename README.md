## Installation & Use

As a single-page javascript app - you can run [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall-lite/) from any web-server, a _secured_ S3 bucket or directly via GitHub Pages (as it is here). [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall-lite/) gives you the ability to easily review and produce reports about your InSpec run, filter the results for easy review and hot-wash, print out reports, generate System Security Plan (SSP) content, and much more.

## Heimdall vs Heimdall-Lite

There are two versions of the MITRE Heimdall Viewer - the full [Heimdall](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall/) and the [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall-lite/) version. We produced each to meet different needs and use-cases.
