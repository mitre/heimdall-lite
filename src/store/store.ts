 * the impacts of breaking changes. If you want to add new getters,
 * do so as a module. Recall that mapState and mapGetter are your friends
 * if your code is getting too long.
 *
 * Furthermore, remember that if a piece of data is used ONLY in your
 * component, it does not need to be here.
 * EG: Filtered controls are useful almost everywhere, whereas
 * the current page of a datatable probably isn't. Be sensible
