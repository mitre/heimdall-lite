Vendors are constantly updating and\n  patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities.\n  Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to\n  promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service\n  packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments,\n  continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system\n  error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.  Organization-defined\n  time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a\n  variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the\n  information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the\n  vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).  This requirement will apply\n  to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across\n  the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that p\n  atch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the\n  capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as\n  system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding\n  the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period\n  utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of\n  security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information\n  Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.  The application will\n  be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates\n  within an identified time period from the availability of the update.

This results in unanticipated application behavior,\n  potentially leading to an application or information system compromise.\n  Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to\n  compromise an application.\n  With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as\n  SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the\n  dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including\n  dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to\n  data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n  Even when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that gets recorded in\n  the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and\n  usability of the system. Available protections include data types, referential\n  constraints, uniqueness constraints, range checking, and application-specific\n  logic. Application-specific logic can be implemented within the database in\n  stored procedures and triggers, where appropriate.\n  This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require\n  collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many\n  cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the\n  application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code.\n  Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure\n  operation of databases that they must not be ignored.
