The usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both\n  the selection and use of mobile code installed on organizational servers and\n  mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations.\n\n      Source code for a Java program is, many times, stored in files with either\n  .java or .jpp file extensions. From the .java and .jpp files the Java compiler\n  produces a binary file with an extension of .class.
