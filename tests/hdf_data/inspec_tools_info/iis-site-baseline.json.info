In order to maintain a\n  connection or session, a web server will generate a session identifier (ID) for\n  each client session when the session is initiated. The session ID allows the\n  web server to track a user session and, in many cases, the user, if the user\n  previously logged into a hosted application.\n\n      By being able to guess session IDs, an attacker can easily perform a\n  man-in-the-middle attack. To truly generate random session identifiers that\n  cannot be reproduced, the web server session ID generator, when used twice with\n  the same input criteria, must generate an unrelated random ID.\n\n    The session ID generator also needs to be a FIPS 140-2-approved generator.","gid":"V-76813","group_title":"SRG-APP-000224-WSR-000136","rule_id":"SV-91509r1_rule","rule_ver":"IISW-SI-000223","cci_ref":["CCI-001188"],"nist":"SC-23 (3) Rev_4","check_content":"Follow the procedures below for each site hosted on the IIS 8.5\n  web server:\n\n  Open the IIS 8.5 Manager.\n\n  Click the site name.\n\n  Under the \"ASP.NET\" section, select \"Session State\".\n\n  Under \"Session State\" Mode Settings, verify the \"In Process\" mode is\n  selected.\n\n  If the \"In Process\" mode is selected, this is not a finding.\n\n  Alternative method:\n\n  Click the site name.\n\n  Select \"Configuration Editor\" under the \"Management\" section.\n\n  From the \"Section:\" drop-down list at the top of the configuration editor,\n  locate \"system.web/sessionState\".\n\n  Verify the \"mode\" reflects \"InProc\".\n\n  If the \"mode\" is not set to \"InProc\", this is a finding.","fix_text":"Follow the procedures below for each site hosted on the IIS 8.5\n  web server:\n\n  Open the IIS 8.5 Manager.\n\n  Click the site name.\n\n  Under the ASP.NET section, select \"Session State\".\n\n  Under \"Session State\" Mode Settings, select the \"In Process\" mode.","impact":"0.7","profile_name":"IIS 8.5 Site Security Technical Implementation Guide","profile_shasum":"17e864b14e63a10e2cc4c5284d30a4cda14f86f00166fd736176642e9e32e9cc","status":["passed"],"message":["PASS -- InProc should cmp == \"InProc\"\n"],"compliance_status":"NotAFinding","finding_details":"All Automated tests passed for the control \n\n PASS -- InProc should cmp == \"InProc\"\n"},"V-76859":{"vuln_num":"V-76859","rule_title":"Cookies exchanged between the IIS 8.5 website and the client must use\n  SSL/TLS, have cookie properties set to prohibit client-side scripts from\n  reading the cookie data and must not be compressed.","vuln_discuss":"A cookie is used when a web server needs to share data with the\n  client's browser.
