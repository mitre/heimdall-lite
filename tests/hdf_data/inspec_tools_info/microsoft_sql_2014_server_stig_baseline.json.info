For example, boundary protection devices can filter\n  certain types of packets to protect devices on an organizations internal\n  network from being directly affected by DoS attacks.\n\n      One way SQL Server can limit exposure to DoS attacks is to restrict the\n  number of connections that can be opened by a single user. SQL Server supports\n  this through the use of logon triggers. (Note, however, that this need not be\n  the only, or even the principal, means for satisfying this requirement.\n  Depending on the architecture and capabilities of the network and application,\n  a network device or an application may be more suitable for providing this\n  protection.)\n\n      When determining the appropriate values for this limit, take the\n  characteristics of the various kinds of user into account, and bear in mind\n  that some applications and some users may need to have multiple sessions open.\n  For example, while a standard account using a simple application may never need\n  more than, say, five connections, a database administrator using SQL Server\n  Management Studio may need significantly more, because each tab in that\n  application counts as a distinct session.\n\n      Architectural note: In SQL Server, a count of active sessions by user can\n  be obtained from one of the dynamic management views. For example:\n            SELECT original_login_name, count(*)\n            FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions\n            WHERE is_user_process = 1\n            GROUP BY original_login_name;\n      However, for this to return an accurate count in a logon trigger, the user\n  would have to have the View Server State privilege. (Without this privilege,\n  the trigger sees information only about the current session, so would always\n  return a count of one.) View Server State would give that user access to a wide\n  swath of information about the server.  One way to avoid this exposure is to\n  create a summary table, and a view of that table that restricts each user to\n  seeing his/her own count, and establish a frequently-run background job to\n  refresh the table (using the above query or similar). The logon trigger then\n  queries the view to obtain a count that is accurate enough for this purpose in\n  most circumstances.","gid":"V-67757","group_title":"SRG-APP-000001-DB-000031","rule_id":"SV-82247r1_rule","rule_ver":"SQL4-00-000100","cci_ref":["CCI-000054"],"nist":"AC-10 Rev_4","check_content":"Review the system documentation to determine whether any limits\n  have been defined.

occur.","vuln_discuss":"Under some circumstances, it may be useful to monitor who/what is\n  reading privilege/permission/role information. Therefore, it must be possible\n  to configure auditing to do this. DBMSs typically make such information\n  available through views or functions.\n\n      This requirement addresses explicit requests for privilege/permission/role\n  membership information. It does not refer to the implicit retrieval of\n  privileges/permissions/role memberships that the DBMS continually performs to\n  determine if any and every action on the database is permitted.\n\n      To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in\n  addition to the successful ones.\n\n      Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit\n  are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It\n  is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy\n  reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains\n  an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft\n  intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.\n\n      This requirement applies to SQL Server Audit-based audit trails; Trace does\n  not have this capability.\n\n      Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all\n  accesses, successful and otherwise, to the system views (and all other\n  schema-scoped objects).  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates\n  the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may\n  report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For\n  example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as\n  successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it\n  contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider\n  failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at\n  all.","gid":"V-67771","group_title":"SRG-APP-000091-DB-000325","rule_id":"SV-82261r2_rule","rule_ver":"SQL4-00-030410","cci_ref":["CCI-000172"],"nist":"AU-12 c Rev_4","check_content":"If SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, and SQL\n  Server Audit is not in use, this is not a finding.\n\n  The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file\n  Audit.sql uses the broad, server-level audit action group\n  SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP for this purpose.
