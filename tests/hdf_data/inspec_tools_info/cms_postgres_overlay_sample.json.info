Once the information\n  is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means\n  may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect.

A comprehensive application\n  account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that\n  accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly\n  addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take\n  action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated,\n  or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as\n  multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of\n  group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access\n  authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination;\n  and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for\n  example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users\n  are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account\n  usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system\n  account usage.  PostgreSQL must be configured to automatically utilize\n  organization-level account management functions, and these functions must\n  immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. Automation may\n  be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an\n  overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management\n  requirements.","severity":"medium","gid":"V-72849","group_title":"SRG-APP-000023-DB-000001","rule_id":"SV-87501r1_rule","rule_ver":"PGS9-00-000500","cci_ref":["CCI-000015"],"nist":"AC-2 (1) Rev_4","check_content":"Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment\n  variable.
