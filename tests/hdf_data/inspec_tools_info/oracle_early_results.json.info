Can\n  use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so\n  as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.\n\n  The system resource limits can be enforced at the session level, the call\n  level, or both. The session level is calculated from the time the user logs on\n  to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL\n  command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a\n  session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled\n  back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is\n  performed.\n\n  Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME\n\n  The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to\n  determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server\n  connections are active. If there is a need to ensure that connections are not\n  left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific\n  parameters), set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from\n  connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.\n\n  When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in\n  use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is\n  intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually\n  handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this\n  terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:\n\n  sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.\n\n  The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic\n  that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of\n  connections.\n\n  Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing\n  may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events\n  that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in\n  downgraded network performance.\n\n  Turning-on expire_time\n\n  To set up these advanced features, simply edit the sqlnet.ora file. If a\n  beginner, follow this procedure:\n\n  Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.\n\n  In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local >> Profile.\n\n  From the list on the right-hand pane, select General.\n\n  Click on the Advanced tab.\n\n  Next, enter the values for the fields or options to set.\n\n  When finished, choose File >> Save Network Configuration to write the changes\n  to the sqlnet.ora file. (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in\n  the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default\n  sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently\n  located sqlnet.ora files.)\n\n  The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter\n\n  The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set\n  in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the\n  required authentication information.\n\n  Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.\n\n  To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an\n  audit trail, should set time-limit values for the\n  sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds.

In addition, monitor and audit to detect either increased threat levels\n  or penetration attempts.\n\n  The following practices improve network security:\n\n  1. Disable the Default Listener.\n  All listeners have a unique name instead of the name LISTENER and have startup\n  protection.\n\n  LISTENER=(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST=)(PORT = 0)))\n\n  This configuration prevents the default listener from starting.\n\n  2.

Set Protection against crafted network packets on database level.\n\n  SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION specifies the action that the database should\n  take when bad packets are received from a possibly malicious client.\n\n  SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION = { NONE | TRACE | LOG | ALERT } (TRACE is the\n  default)\n\n  NONE: The database server ignores the bad packets and does not generate any\n  trace files or log messages. (Not recommended)\n\n  TRACE: A detailed trace file is generated when bad packets are received, which\n  can be used to debug any problems in client/server communication.\n\n  LOG: A minimal log message is printed in the alert logfile and in the server\n  trace file. A minimal amount of disk space is used.\n\n  ALERT: An alert message is sent to a DBA or monitoring console.\n\n  SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION specifies the further execution of a server\n  process when receiving bad packets from a possibly malicious client.\n\n  SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION = { CONTINUE | (DELAY,integer) |\n  (DROP,integer) } (DROP,3 is the default)\n\n  CONTINUE: The server process continues execution.

(Not recommended)\n\n  (DELAY, integer) :The client experiences a delay of integer seconds before the\n  server process accepts the next request from the same client connection.\n  Malicious clients are prevented from excessive consumption of server resources\n  while legitimate clients experience degradation in performance but can continue\n  to function.\n\n  (DROP, integer) : The server forcefully terminates the client connection after\n  integer bad packets. The server protects itself at the expense of the client\n  (for example, a client transaction may be lost). The client may reconnect and\n  attempt the same operation.\n\n  SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS specifies the number of authentication attempts\n  that can be made by a client on a connection to the server process. After the\n  specified number of failure attempts, the connection will be automatically\n  dropped by the server process.\n\n  SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = n (3 is the default) Values range from 1 to\n  unlimited.

When a host computer has multiple IP addresses associated with multiple\n  network interface controller (NIC) cards, configure the listener to the\n  specific IP address.\n\n  You can restrict the listener to listen on a specific IP address. Oracle\n  recommends that you specify the specific IP addresses on these types of\n  computers, rather than allowing the listener to listen on all IP addresses.\n  Restricting the listener to specific IP addresses helps to prevent an intruder\n  from stealing a TCP end point from under the listener process.\n\n  5. Restrict the privileges of the listener, so that it cannot read or write\n  files in the database or the Oracle server address space.\n\n  The default configuration for external procedures does not require a network\n  listener to work with Oracle Database and the extproc agent. The extproc agent\n  is spawned directly by Oracle Database and eliminates the risks that the\n  extproc agent might be spawned by Oracle Listener unexpectedly. This default\n  configuration is recommended for maximum security. For more information about\n  securing external procedures see\n  https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/app_devs.htm#DBSEG656\n  However, the extproc agent can be configured to be spawned by a listener. In\n  that case (not recommended) the listener should have restricted privileges.\n\n  6. Use a firewall, IAW DoD network policy and guidance.\n\n  Appropriately placed and configured firewalls can prevent outside access to\n  your databases.\n\n  7. Prevent unauthorized administration of the Oracle listener.\n\n  Local administration of the listener is secure by default through the local\n  operating system. Therefore configuring a password is neither required nor\n  recommended for secure local administration. However, a password can be\n  configured for the listener to provide security for administrative operations,\n  such as starting or stopping the listener, viewing a list of supported\n  services, or saving changes to the Listener Control configuration.\n\n  By default, Oracle Net Listener permits only local administration for security\n  reasons. As a policy, the listener can be administered only by the user who\n  started it. This is enforced through local operating system authentication. For\n  example, if user1 starts the listener, then only user1 can administer it. Any\n  other user trying to administer the listener gets an error. The super user is\n  the only exception.\n\n  Oracle recommends that you perform listener administration in the default mode\n  (secure by means of local operating system authentication), and access the\n  system remotely using a remote logon. Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control\n  can also be used for remote administration.\n\n  8. Encrypt network traffic.  (Mandatory for sensitive data and optional for\n  non-sensitive, as covered in other STIG requirements.)\n\n  Where applicable, use Oracle network data encryption to encrypt network traffic\n  among clients, databases, and application servers.\n\n  9. Set Connect Rate to organization defined limit. (Also required by\n  O121-C2-019100/SRG-APP-000245-DB-000132)\n\n  The connection rate limiter feature in Oracle Net Listener enables a database\n  administrator to limit the number of new connections handled by the listener.\n  When this feature is enabled, Oracle Net Listener imposes a user-specified\n  maximum limit on the number of new connections handled by the listener every\n  second.\n\n  CONNECTION_RATE_LISTENER=10\n  LISTENER=\n  (ADDRESS_LIST=\n  (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1521)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))\n  (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1522)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))\n  (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1526))\n  )\n\n  10. Setup Valid Node Checking.\n  (See also O121-BP-025600.)\n\n  Valid node checking is a security feature that protects DBMS instances from\n  malevolent or errant Oracle Net connections over TCP/IP, without the need for a\n  firewall or IP address filtering at the operating system-level. The feature is\n  controlled by the three parameters; tcp.validnode_checking, tcp.invited_nodes,\n  and tcp.excluded_nodes.\n\n  Modify the sqlnet.ora file manually\n  TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING=yes\n  (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is\n  in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora\n  configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located\n  sqlnet.ora files.)\n\n  If this parameter is set to yes, then incoming connections are allowed only if\n  they originate from a node that conforms to the list specified by\n  TCP.INVITED_NODES or TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters.\n\n  The TCP.INVITED_NODES and TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters are valid only when the\n  TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING parameter is set to yes (no is the default).\n\n  The TCP.INVITED_NODES and TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters are valid only when the\n  TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING parameter is set to yes.\n\n  Modify the listener.ora file manually\n\n  TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES Syntax:\n  TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)\n\n  Example:\n  TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(finance.us.example.com, mktg.us.example.com, 192.0.2.25,\n  172.30.*, 2001:DB8:200C:417A/32)\n\n  TCP.INVITED_NODES Syntax:\n  TCP.INVITED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)\n\n  Example:\n  TCP.INVITED_NODES=(sales.us.example.com, hr.us.example.com, 192.0.*,\n  2001:DB8:200C:433B/32)\n\n  Usage Notes:\n\n  Use TCP.INVITED_NODES to specify which clients are allowed access to the\n  database. This list takes precedence over the TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameter if\n  both lists are present. These parameters can use wildcards for IPv4 addresses\n  and CIDR notation for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\n  11. Apply Listener Security Patches.\n  (See also O121-C1-011100/SRG-APP-000133-DB-000205.)\n\n  Critical Patch Updates are cumulative. Therefore, the latest patch will contain\n  all previous security patches for the Listener.\n\n  12. Ensure that listener logging is turned on.\n\n  Listener logging is on by default. If logging is not on, configure logging for\n  all listeners in order to capture Listener commands and brute force password\n  attacks.\n\n  13. Monitor the listener logfile.\n\n  The logfile may contain TNS-01169, TNS-01189, TNS-01190, or TNS-12508 errors,\n  which may signify attacks or inappropriate activity. Monitor the logfile and\n  generate an alert whenever these errors are encountered.","impact":"0.3","profile_name":"Oracle Database 12c Security Technical Implementation

An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that\n  stores authentication and signing credentials.\n\n  This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password\n  credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured,\n  application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names\n  and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed,\n  and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing\n  application code whenever user names or passwords change.\n\n  The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where\n  public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you\n  cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password\n  store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage\n  these credentials.\n\n  How Does the External Password Store Work?\n\n  Typically, users (and applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to\n  databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database\n  connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an\n  Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network.\n  If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.\n\n  For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database,\n  or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another\n  possibility is a host:port:sid string.\n\n  The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a\n  client that is not configured to use the external password store:\n\n    CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com\n    Enter password: password\n\n    CONNECT salesapp@orasales\n    Enter password: password\n\n    CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17\n    Enter password: password\n\n  In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string\n  for the database shown as specified in three different ways. Could use its URL\n  sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora\n  file, or its host:port:sid string.\n\n  However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store,\n  applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement\n  syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:\n\n    CONNECT /@db_connect_string\n\n    CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA\n\n    CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER\n\n  In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access\n  the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the\n  earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string;\n  cannot create one connection string for multiple users.\n\n  In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely\n  stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of\n  this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the\n  wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the\n  user they represent.","fix_text":"Develop, document, and maintain a list of DBMS database objects,\n  database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined\n  within or external to the DBMS that access the database, and DBMS/user\n  environment files/settings in the System Security Plan.\n\n  Record whether they do or do not contain DBMS passwords. If passwords are\n  present, ensure they are encoded or encrypted and protected by host system\n  security.\n\n  - - - - -\n  The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using\n  Oracle Wallet.\n\n  Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password\n  facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords\n  for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized\n  facility to perform this function.\n\n  Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store\n\n  To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific\n  credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents\n  provides information that can be used to decide whether to add or delete\n  credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password\n  store, enter the following command at the command line:\n\n  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\n  For example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets\n  -listCredential\n\n  The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose\n  external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command\n  lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the\n  corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\n  Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store\n\n  If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as\n  Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle\n  Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this\n  type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\n  For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them\n  for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in\n  sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE,\n  allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\n  If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then\n  perform the following configuration task:\n\n  1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command\n  line:\n\n  mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create\n\n  For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -create\n  Enter password: password\n\n  The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be\n  created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon\n  feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the\n  client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\n  The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n  2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following\n  syntax at the command line:\n\n  mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\n  Enter password: password\n\n  For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets\n  -createCredential oracle system\n  Enter password: password\n\n  In this specification, the wallet_location is the path to the directory where\n  the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT\n  /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string\n  specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS\n  alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name\n  used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is\n  located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in\n  ORACLE_HOME  etwork\\admin on Windows.  The username is the database logon credential. When\n  prompted, enter the password for this user.\n\n  3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set\n  it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if\n  created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to\n  /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into client sqlnet.ora file:\n\n      WALLET_LOCATION =\n             (SOURCE =\n               (METHOD = FILE)\n               (METHOD_DATA =\n             (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n             )\n            )\n\n  4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter\n  and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\n  SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\n  This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the\n  information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to\n  databases.\n\n  When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a\n  wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously\n  specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a\n  user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also\n  fail.\n\n  Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the\n  SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\n          WALLET_LOCATION =\n              (SOURCE =\n                (METHOD = FILE)\n                (METHOD_DATA =\n              (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n                )\n               )\n          SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n          SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\n          SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1\n\n  Note: \"SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1\" is the actual value, not a suggestion to use\n  one or the other.\n\n  (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is\n  in use.

In a default\n  Oracle installation, all passwords are stored in an encrypted manner.  Ask the\n  DBA if they have created an External Password Store for applications, batch\n  jobs, and scripts to use.\n\n  Secure External Password Store\n\n  Can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a\n  client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that\n  stores authentication and signing credentials.\n\n  This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password\n  credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured,\n  application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names\n  and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed,\n  and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing\n  application code whenever user names or passwords change.\n\n  The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where\n  public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, cannot\n  use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store\n  of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these\n  credentials.\n\n  How Does the External Password Store Work?\n\n  Typically, users (and as applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to\n  databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database\n  connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an\n  Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network.\n  If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.\n\n  For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database,\n  or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another\n  possibility is a host:port:sid string.\n\n  The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a\n  client that is not configured to use the external password store:\n\n    CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com\n    Enter password: password\n\n    CONNECT salesapp@orasales\n    Enter password: password\n\n    CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17\n    Enter password: password\n\n  In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string\n  for the database shown as specified in three different ways. Could use its URL\n  sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora\n  file, or its host:port:sid string.\n\n  However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store,\n  applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement\n  syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:\n\n    CONNECT /@db_connect_string\n\n    CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA\n\n    CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER\n\n  In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access\n  the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the\n  earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string;\n  cannot create one connection string for multiple users.\n\n  In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely\n  stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of\n  this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the\n  wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the\n  user they represent.","fix_text":"Design DBMS application code and batch job code that is compiled,\n  encoded or encrypted, to NOT contain passwords.\n\n  - - - - -\n  Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password\n  facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords\n  for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized\n  facility to perform this function.\n\n  Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store\n\n  To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific\n  credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents\n  provides information can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials\n  from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the\n  following command at the command line:\n\n    $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\n    For example:\n\n    $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\n  The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose\n  external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command\n  lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the\n  corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\n  Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store\n\n  If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as\n  Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle\n  Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this\n  type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\n  For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them\n  for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in\n  sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE,\n  allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\n  If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then\n  perform the following configuration task:\n\n   1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command\n  line:\n\n   mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create\n\n      For example:\n\n      mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -create\n      Enter password: password\n\n  The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be\n  created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon\n  feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the\n  client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\n  The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n   2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following\n  syntax at the command line:\n\n      mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\n      Enter password: password\n\n      For example:\n\n      mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential\n  oracle system\n      Enter password: password\n\n      In this specification:\n\n  The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.\n  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be\n  identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.\n\n  The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the\n  tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an\n  Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the\n  $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME  etwork\\admin on Windows.\n\n  The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the\n  password for this user.\n\n   3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set\n  it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if\n  the wallet was created in\n         $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora12,\n  then need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:\n\n      WALLET_LOCATION =\n             (SOURCE =\n               (METHOD = FILE)\n               (METHOD_DATA =\n             (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n             )\n            )\n\n   4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter\n  and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\n         SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\n  setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the\n  information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to\n  databases.\n\n  When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a\n  wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously\n  specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a\n  user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also\n  fail.\n\n  Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the\n  SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\n  Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set\n\n          WALLET_LOCATION =\n              (SOURCE =\n                (METHOD = FILE)\n                (METHOD_DATA =\n              (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n                )\n               )\n\n          SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n          SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\n          SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1\n\n  Note:  \"SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1\" is the actual value, not a suggestion to\n  use one or the other.\n\n  (Note:  this assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is\n  in use.

For more information, see \"SQL standard authorization\" in\n  the Java DB Developer's Guide.\n  Limitations\n\n  The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:\n\n  Table-level privileges:\n\n  All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are\n  stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is\n  granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to\n  the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID\n  contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The\n  remaining privilege type fields are set to N.\n\n  When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the\n  Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the\n  SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the\n  statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency\n  of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).\n  The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege\n  type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the\n  view is dependent on.\n\n  When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and\n  table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are\n  dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from\n  user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is\n  modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke\n  invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though\n  the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2),\n  TABLEID(user1.t1).\n\n  Column-level privileges:\n\n  Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in\n  one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the\n  SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to\n  the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains\n  user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.\n\n  When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the\n  subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the\n  object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates\n  the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency\n  manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for\n  GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that\n  the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly\n  which columns the view is dependent on.\n\n  When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee,\n  table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table\n  ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on\n  column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for\n  GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement.\n  The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view\n  user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the\n  column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).\n\n  If Unified Auditing is used:\n\n  Apply the same process used in standard auditing to the tables with AUDSYS as\n  the owner.","impact":"0.0","profile_name":"Oracle Database 12c Security Technical Implementation Guide","profile_shasum":"6a8047b6a1ee06ffa684da2fa3b403e8d8b033d344ad79aa36b9aa9c04228338","status":["skipped"],"message":["NOT_APPLICABLE -- Description: If audit data were to become compromised, then competent forensic\n  analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system\n  activity is impossible to achieve.\n\n      To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the\n  application must protect audit information from unauthorized modification.\n\n      This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend\n  upon system architecture and design.

The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains\n  user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.\n\n  When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the\n  subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the\n  object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates\n  the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency\n  manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for\n  GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that\n  the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly\n  which columns the view is dependent on.\n\n  When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee,\n  table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table\n  ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on\n  column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for\n  GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement.\n  The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view\n  user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the\n  column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).\n\n  If Unified Auditing is used:\n\n  Apply the same process used in standard auditing to the tables with AUDSYS as\n  the owner.","impact":"0.0","profile_name":"Oracle Database 12c Security Technical Implementation Guide","profile_shasum":"6a8047b6a1ee06ffa684da2fa3b403e8d8b033d344ad79aa36b9aa9c04228338","status":["skipped"],"message":["NOT_APPLICABLE -- Description: If audit data were to become compromised, then competent forensic\n  analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system\n  activity is impossible to achieve.\n\n      To ensure the veracity of audit data the information system and/or the\n  application must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion.

Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords\n  for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized\n  facility to perform this function.\n\n  Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.\n\n  To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific\n  credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents\n  provides information used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from\n  the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the\n  following command at the command line:\n\n    $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\n    For example:\n\n    $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\n  The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose\n  external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command\n  lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the\n  corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\n  Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store\n\n  If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as\n  Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle\n  Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this\n  type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\n  For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them\n  for database authentication, set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in\n  sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE,\n  allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\n  If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then\n  perform the following configuration task:\n\n  1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command\n  line:\n  orapki create -wallet wallet_location  -auto_login_local\n\n  For example:\n  orapki wallet create -wallet c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets\n  -auto_login_local\n  Enter password: password\n\n  The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be\n  created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon\n  feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the\n  client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\n  The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n  2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following\n  syntax at the command line:\n  mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\n  Enter password: password\n\n  For example:\n  mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential\n  oracle system\n  Enter password: password\n\n  In this specification:\n  The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.\n  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be\n  identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.\n\n  The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the\n  tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an\n  Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the\n  $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME  etwork\\admin on Windows.\n\n  The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the\n  password for this user.\n\n  3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set\n  it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if\n  the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and the Oracle home is set\n  to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into the client sqlnet.ora\n  file:\n\n      WALLET_LOCATION = \n             (SOURCE =\n               (METHOD = FILE)\n               (METHOD_DATA =\n             (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n             )\n            )\n\n  4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter\n  and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\n         SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\n  This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the\n  information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to\n  databases.\n\n  When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a\n  wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously\n  specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a\n  user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also\n  fail.\n\n  Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the\n  SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\n  Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set\n\n          WALLET_LOCATION =\n              (SOURCE =\n                (METHOD = FILE)\n                (METHOD_DATA =\n              (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)\n                )\n               )\n\n          SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n          SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\n          SSL_VERSION =1.2 or 1.1\n\n  (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is\n  in use. Please see the supplemental file Non-default sqlnet.ora\n  configurations.pdf for how to find multiple and/or differently located\n  sqlnet.ora files.)\n\n  Note: SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1 is the actual value, not a suggestion to\n  use one or the other.","impact":"0.7","profile_name":"Oracle Database 12c Security Technical Implementation Guide","profile_shasum":"6a8047b6a1ee06ffa684da2fa3b403e8d8b033d344ad79aa36b9aa9c04228338","status":["skipped"],"message":["SKIPPED -- Test: A manual review is required to ensure when using command-line tools such as Oracle SQL*Plus, which can\n    accept a plain-text password, users must use an alternative logon method that\n    does not expose the password\nMessage: A manual review is required to ensure when using command-line tools such as Oracle SQL*Plus, which can\n    accept a plain-text password, users must use an alternative logon method that\n    does not expose the password\n"],"compliance_status":"Not_Reviewed","finding_details":"Automated test skipped due to known accepted condition in the control : \n\nSKIPPED -- Test: A manual review is required to ensure when using command-line tools such as Oracle SQL*Plus, which can\n    accept a plain-text password, users must use an alternative logon method that\n    does not expose the password\nMessage: A manual review is required to ensure when using command-line tools such as Oracle SQL*Plus, which can\n    accept a plain-text password, users must use an alternative logon method that\n    does not expose the password\n"},"V-61597":{"vuln_num":"V-61597","rule_title":"Owners of privileged accounts must use non-privileged accounts for\n  non-administrative activities.","vuln_discuss":"Use of privileged accounts for non-administrative purposes puts data\n  at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure.

When resetting\n  (rekeying) the master encryption key for TDE column encryption, the master\n  encryption key for TDE tablespace encryption also gets reset. The ALTER SYSTEM\n  SET ENCRYPTION KEY command resets the tablespace master encryption key. Before\n  creating an encrypted tablespace, the Oracle wallet containing the tablespace\n  master encryption key must be open. The wallet must also be open before\n  accessing data in an encrypted tablespace. The security administrator needs to\n  open the Oracle wallet after starting the Oracle instance. A restart of the\n  Oracle instance requires the security administrator to open the wallet again.\n  The security administrator also needs to open the wallet before performing\n  database recovery operations. This is because background processes may require\n  access to encrypted redo and undo logs. When performing database recovery, the\n  wallet must be opened before opening the database. This is illustrated in the\n  following statements:\n\n  SQL> STARTUP MOUNT;\n  SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION WALLET OPEN IDENTIFIED BY \"password\";\n  SQL> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;\n\n  Can also choose to use auto logon wallets if the environment does not require\n  the extra security provided by a wallet that needs to be explicitly opened;\n  however, this is not the recommended practice.\n\n  Creating the wallet/keystore\n\n  SQL> ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT CREATE KEYSTORE '/app/wallet' IDENTIFIED BY\n  password;\n\n  keystore altered.\n\n  Set the TDE Master Encryption Key in the Software Keystore\n\n  SQL> ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEY IDENTIFIED BY password WITH BACKUP USING\n  'backup_identifier';\n\n  keystore altered.\n\n  Creating an Encrypted Tablespace\n\n  The CREATE TABLESPACE command enables the creation of an encrypted tablespace.\n  The permanent_tablespace_clause enables choosing the encryption algorithm and\n  the key length for encryption.

If no\n  encryption algorithm is specified, the default encryption algorithm is used.\n  The default encryption algorithm is AES128.\n\n  Note: The ENCRYPTION keyword in the permanent_tablespace_clause is used to\n  specify the encryption algorithm.

If the\n  constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, violations resulting from data\n  entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the\n  constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be\n  put in the validated state.\n\n  Can identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to\n  enable the constraint. See \"Reporting Constraint Exceptions\". All rows\n  violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which can be examined.\n\n  ENABLE, NOVALIDATE Constraint State\n  When a constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, all subsequent statements\n  are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the\n  table is not checked. A table with ENABLE, NOVALIDATE constraints can contain\n  invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Constraints\n  in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state is most useful in data warehouse configurations\n  that are uploading valid OLTP data.\n\n  Enabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint\n  novalidate is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also,\n  validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks\n  during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint).\n  Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation.\n  Hence, enabling without validating reduces the downtime typically associated\n  with enabling a constraint.\n\n  Efficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure\n\n  Using integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best\n  benefits:\n      Disable state.\n      Perform the operation (load, export, import).\n      ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state.\n      Enable state.\n\n  Some benefits of using constraints in this order are:\n      No locks are held.\n      All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.\n      Constraint enabling is done in parallel.\n      Concurrent activity on table is permitted.\n\n  Setting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition\n  When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE\n  statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as\n  determined by the specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the\n  ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database\n  automatically enables and validates the constraint.\n\n  Disabling Constraints Upon Definition\n  The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable\n  integrity constraints:\n\n  CREATE TABLE emp (\n     empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE,   . . . ;\n\n  ALTER TABLE emp\n     ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;\n\n  An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint\n  never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint.\n  The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.\n\n  Enabling Constraints Upon Definition\n\n  The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable\n  integrity constraints:\n\n  CREATE TABLE emp (\n      empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ;\n\n  ALTER TABLE emp\n      ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);\n\n  An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity\n  constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint.\n  If this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is\n  not stored and not enabled.\n\n  When enabling a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, an associated index is\n  created.","fix_text":"Modify database code to properly validate data before it is put\n  into the database or acted upon by the database.\n\n  Modify database to contain field definitions for each field in the database.\n\n  Modify database to contain constraints on database columns and tables that\n  require them for data validity.\n\n  Review the application schemas implemented on the system.

Long-running queries and other operations are\n  not subject to this limit.\n\n  COMPOSITE_LIMIT - See Oracle documentation for more details.\n\n\n  Password Parameters\n\n  Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set\n  lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes,\n  specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).\n\n  FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log on to the\n  user account before the account is locked. If omitting this clause, then the\n  default is 10 times.\n\n  PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used\n  for authentication. If setting a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the\n  password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further\n  connections are rejected. If omitting this clause, then the default is 180 days.\n\n  PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set\n  in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of\n  days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the\n  number of password changes required before the current password can be reused.\n  For these parameters to have any effect, specify an integer for both of them.\n\n  If specifying a value for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse\n  a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified\n  for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for\n  PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.\n\n  For example, if specifying PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to\n  10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has\n  already been changed 10 times.\n\n  If specifying a value for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for\n  the other, then the user can never reuse a password.\n\n  If specifying DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value\n  defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED\n  in the DEFAULT profile. If the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT\n  profile has not changed, then the database treats the value for that parameter\n  as UNLIMITED.\n\n  If setting both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores\n  both of them. This is the default if omitting both parameters.\n\n  PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after\n  the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If omitting this\n  clause, then the default is 1 day.\n\n  PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins\n  during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If omitting this clause,\n  then the default is 7 days.\n\n  PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - The PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION clause lets a PL/SQL\n  password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE\n  PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but can create\n  your own routine or use third-party software instead.","impact":"0.5","profile_name":"Oracle Database 12c Security Technical Implementation Guide","profile_shasum":"6a8047b6a1ee06ffa684da2fa3b403e8d8b033d344ad79aa36b9aa9c04228338","status":["skipped"],"message":["SKIPPED -- Test: A manual review is required to ensure the DBMS provides a mechanism to automatically identify accounts\n    designated as temporary or emergency accounts\nMessage: A manual review is required to ensure the DBMS provides a mechanism to automatically identify accounts\n    designated as temporary or emergency accounts\n"],"compliance_status":"Not_Reviewed","finding_details":"Automated test skipped due to known accepted condition in the control : \n\nSKIPPED -- Test: A manual review is required to ensure the DBMS provides a mechanism to automatically identify accounts\n    designated as temporary or emergency accounts\nMessage: A manual review is required to ensure the DBMS provides a mechanism to automatically identify accounts\n    designated as temporary or emergency accounts\n"},"V-61699":{"vuln_num":"V-61699","rule_title":"DBMS backup and restoration files must be protected from unauthorized\n  access.","vuln_discuss":"Information system backup is a critical step in maintaining data\n  assurance and availability.\n\n      User-level information is data generated by information system and/or\n  application users.

With\n  encrypted files stored on a mount point with limited access, the integrity of\n  the files can be trusted.\n\n  - - - - -\n  Notes on Oracle Backup and Recovery Solutions\n\n  When implementing a backup and recovery strategy, have the following solutions\n  available:\n\n  --  Recovery Manager (RMAN)\n  Recovery Manager is fully integrated with the Oracle database to perform a\n  range of backup and recovery activities, including maintaining an RMAN\n  repository of historical data about backups. Can access RMAN through the\n  command line or through Oracle Enterprise Manager.\n\n  --  User-managed backup and recovery\n  In this solution, perform backup and recovery with a mixture of host operating\n  system commands and SQL*Plus recovery commands. Responsible for determining all\n  aspects of when and how backups and recovery are done.\n\n  --  Media management\n  If not wanting to use RMAN with an encrypted backup, consider configuring RMAN\n  to make backups to a media manager.  On most platforms, to back up to and\n  restore from sequential media such as tape, must integrate a media manager with\n  the Oracle database. Can use Oracle Secure Backup, which supports both database\n  and file system backups to tape, as the media manager. See Oracle Secure Backup\n  Administrator's Guide to learn how to set up RMAN for use specifically with\n  Oracle Secure Backup.\n\n  These solutions are supported by Oracle and are fully documented, but RMAN is\n  the preferred solution for database backup and recovery. RMAN provides a common\n  interface for backup tasks across different host operating systems and offers\n  several backup techniques not available through user-managed methods.\n\n  --  Incremental backups:\n  An incremental backup stores only blocks changed since a previous backup.\n  Thus, they provide more compact backups and faster recovery, thereby reducing\n  the need to apply redo during data file media recovery. If enabling block\n  change tracking, then can improve performance by avoiding full scans of every\n  input data file. Can use the BACKUP INCREMENTAL command to perform incremental\n  backups.\n\n  --  Block media recovery:\n  Can repair a data file with only a small number of corrupt data blocks without\n  taking it off-line or restoring it from backup. Can use the RECOVER BLOCK\n  command to perform block media recovery.\n\n  --  Binary compression:\n  A binary compression mechanism integrated into Oracle Database reduces the size\n  of backups.\n\n  --  Encrypted backups:\n  RMAN uses backup encryption capabilities integrated into Oracle Database to\n  store backup sets in an encrypted format. To create encrypted backups on disk,\n  the database must use the Advanced Security Option. To create encrypted backups\n  directly on tape, RMAN must use the Oracle Secure Backup SBT interface but does\n  not require the Advanced Security Option.\n\n  --  Automated database duplication:\n  Easily creates a copy of the database, supporting various storage\n  configurations, including direct duplication between ASM databases.\n\n  --  Cross-platform data conversion:\n  Whether using RMAN or user-managed methods, can supplement physical backups\n  with logical backups of schema objects made with Data Pump Export utility. Can\n  later use Data Pump Import to re-create data after restore and recovery.\n  Logical backups are mostly beyond the scope of the backup and recovery\n  documentation.","impact":"0.5","profile_name":"Oracle Database 12c Security Technical Implementation Guide","profile_shasum":"6a8047b6a1ee06ffa684da2fa3b403e8d8b033d344ad79aa36b9aa9c04228338","status":["skipped"],"message":["SKIPPED -- Test: A manual review is required to ensure recovery procedures and technical system features exist to ensure\n    recovery is done in a secure and verifiable manner\nMessage: A manual review is required to ensure recovery procedures and technical system features exist to ensure\n    recovery is done in a secure and verifiable manner\n"],"compliance_status":"Not_Reviewed","finding_details":"Automated test skipped due to known accepted condition in the control : \n\nSKIPPED -- Test: A manual review is required to ensure recovery procedures and technical system features exist to ensure\n    recovery is done in a secure and verifiable manner\nMessage: A manual review is required to ensure recovery procedures and technical system features exist to ensure\n    recovery is done in a secure and verifiable manner\n"},"V-61409":{"vuln_num":"V-61409","rule_title":"Audit trail data must be retained for at least one year.","vuln_discuss":"Without preservation, a complete discovery of an attack or suspicious\n  activity may not be determined.
