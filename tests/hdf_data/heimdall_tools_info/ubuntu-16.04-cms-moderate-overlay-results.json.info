Password complexity or strength is a\nmeasure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing\nand brute-force attacks.\n\n    Password complexity is one factor in determining how long it takes to crack\na password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible\ncombinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.\n\n    Special characters are those characters that are not alphanumeric.
